## HTML and CSS
HTML per se is code/ language that we use to tell the computer to do what we want to have on our webpage. The HTML code is made up of two main parts, i.e., elements and tags. Elements are those characters or words in blue, while tags are the opening and closing tag arround the  information. The closing tag should always bear a forward slash in it, just before the element. The codes that we use on HTML are diffrent from those of markdown. 
For instance,
In markdown we use #, ## ... for heading 1, heading 2 etc, respectively. In contrast, in HTML we use `<h1>heading-1</h1>`, `<h2>heading-2</h2>`. Unlike what is in the markdown, we need to embade a non-heading (block text) as  `<p>zzzzzzzzz</p>`.
Moreover, the whole body of text (heading and non-heading) should be enclosed in between `<body>...</body>` as like `</body>heading + non-heading</body>`. Finally, start and end of an HTML file should be enclosed by `<html>...</html>`. Hence, the overall structure of an HTML file looks like as follows:
```
<html>
<body>
<h1>.....</h1>
<p>..............................</p>
<h2>.....</h2>
<p>..............................</p>
</body>
</html>
```

For instance, using CSS it is possible to manipulate the background color and font size, type and style. It works by associating rules with HTML element. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule comprises two main parts, viz. a <span style="color: blue;"> ***selector*** </span> and <span style="color: red;"> ***declaration*** </span>.

## HTML5 layout
For a long period of time, web page developers used `<dev>` elements to group related elements together on the page (such as elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Developers used class or ID attributes to indicate the role of the `<div>` elements in the stricture of the page. 
HTML5, however, has come up with a new feature or set of elements that allow the developers to divide up parts of the page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content the user will find in them. As a result, there are numerous developers using this version of HTML.

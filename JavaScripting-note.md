# JAVASCRIPT
A **Script** is a series of instructions (written by a software developer or a coder) that a computer can follow step-by-step, so that a user-defined output will be obtained. Therein, each individual step is knwn as a ***statement***. Statements should end with a semicolon. JavaScript is case sensitive so **hourNow** means different from **HourNow** or **HOURNOW**.  Some features of statements are:
- statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line
- statements can be organized into code blocks
        - some statements are enclosed by curly braces. These are known as **code blocks**. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon. 
A script will have to temporarily store the bit of information it needs to do its jobs. It can store this data in a **variable**. A variable is a value that changes or varies each time the script runs with a certain parametes. 
There are <ins> three different data types </ins> in JavaScript. Such as ***numbers***, ***strings*** and ***Booleans***.
Examples in each case:
- Numeric data tyrp: numerical data tyrpe handles numbers. Ex. 0.75
- string data type: consists of letters and pther characters. Ex. 'Hi, Ivy!' or '0.75'
- Boolean data type: can have one of two variables, such as **true** or **false**.

# Computer architecture and logic
## How doe computers work?
In contrast to the manual activities performed either by human beings or mechanical machines, the automated world is now coming to the reality in the way that different sophisticated machines (i.e., semi-autonomous) are built to make ease of human tasks. These machines can be called computers. The process inside these machines (i.e., computers) can be divided into four:
- input information
- storage as data
- processing
- output result 
In the modern computers, external (environmental) signals can be taken as an input and this will then be sent to storage memory. From the storage memory, it goes to the processor unit. This input will go back and forth between the storage memory and processor unit until it will be ready for output. The computer output could be in termas of text, photo, audio, video games or virtual reality.
## Data and binary
The computer works in 1 and 0 format. That means, data can be represented in '1' or '0', 'true' or 'false', 'on' or 'off' and/or 'yes' or 'no'. These alternative forms (such as 'on' and 'off') with a single wire is called bit. Bit is the smallest unit of information that a computer can store. More wires then means more '1s' and '0s'. 
Unlike the decial number system (where we have 10 digits, 0 - 9), in the binary number system we do have two digits (0 and 1). In binary number system, different data types can be represented, such as numbers, texts, photos, videos etc. The images, videos or other graphics are composed of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixels are represented by colors which are then represneted by numbers. Depending on the number of wires or 0s and 1s or what we call bits, the quality of audio or images or videos can be controlled. 
## Circuits and logic
Ever input and output are information that are represented in 0s and 1s. In order to process the information that comes in as an input and result an output, the computer needs to combine millions of small electronic components called circuits. There are different kinds of circuits: NOT, AND, NOR, OR, XOR, ADDER etc.
## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
The four different parts of a computer are performed by different parts. The input of can be done by a keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, themostat sensor etc. Whereas the devices can be screen, printers.
## Hardware and software
The harware is all the computer stufs that we see by our necked eye like circuits, chips, plugs, speakers, wires etc. While a software is a program that we do not see in the computer. Software instructs the CPU what to do. The softwares installed/ loaded into the computer memory by the help of the <ins> operating system (master program) </ins>.

# Script
It is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to acheive a desired goal. A script can be taken analogous to a recipes, handbooks and/or manuals. While writing a script, there are three major steps to be followed: 
1. define the goal
1. design the script
1. code each step in a very detailed way
# Expressions
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Therein, broadly speaking, there are two types of expressions:
1. expressions that just assign a value to a variable
1. expression that use two or more value to return a single value
Expressions relay on things known as operators, so that ther allow programmers to to create a single value from one or more values. In this regard, we can classify operators into 
- assignment operators
- comparison operators
- arithmetic operators
- logical operators
- string operators
## Arithmetic operators
JavaScript comprises the following mathematical operators (arithmetic operators):
1. `+` adds one value to another
1. `-` substracts one value from another
1. `/` divides two values
1. `*` multiplies two values
1. `++` adds one to the current number
1. `--` substracts one from the current number
1. `%` divides two values and returns the reminder 
## String operator
There is just one string operator: the `+` symbol. It is used to join the strings om either side of it. There are many cases where you may need to join two or more strings to create a single value. This process is called concatenation. 
## What is a function?
***Function*** let a programmer to group a series of stetments together to perform a specific task. If different parts of the script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same statement).
 If you need to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. This name should describe the task it is performing. Some functions are needed to be provided with the information in order to achieve a given task. Pieces of information passed to a function to perform a certain task is called **parameters**. 
 To create a function, it needs to be given with a name and write a statement needed to achieve its task inside a curly braces. This process is known as **function declaration**. When a function is run/ executed to perform a task, it is called **calling the function**. When a function is called by its name, the statment represented by it will run. When a function is written and run, an answer will be given, the response is known as a **return value**.
